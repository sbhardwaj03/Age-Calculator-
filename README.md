This Python script calculates and prints the age of an individual based on their date of birth. The ageCalculator function takes three parameters: year (y), month (m), and day (d), which represent the date of birth. It calculates the age by determining the number of days between the current date and the date of birth, then divides by 365.25 to account for leap years. To use this script, simply call the ageCalculator function with the desired date of birth as arguments, and the script will print the calculated age. The provided example calculates the age for someone born on December 29, 2003.
